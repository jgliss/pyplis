"""Pyplis introduction script 3 - manual creation of image lists.

This script gives an introduction into the creation and the handling of
ImgList objects. Image lists normally contain images of a certain type (e.g.
on, off, dark, offset). The separation by these file types is normally done
automatically within a Dataset object (see e.g. following script
ex0_4_imglists_auto.py or example script ex01_analysis_setup.py) using a
certain camera type (see previous script ex0_2_camera_setup.py).

In this example these features are NOT used but rather, an on and off band
image list is created manually without previous definition of the Camera type
(i.e. file naming convention, etc.). The script starts with creating an ImgList
containing all images of type FITS found in the test data image base directory.
On and off band lists are then consecutively extracted from this list using
the list method ``separate_by_substr_filename``.

Furthermore, some basic image preparation features of ImgList objects are
introduced (e.g. linking of lists, dark correction, automatic blurring,
cropping, size reduction).

pyplis example script no. 5: Automatic cell calibration

Script showing how to use the automatic cell calibration engine which only 
requires to specify start / stop time stamps of a calibration window. Based on 
that sub time windows for each cell as well as suitable background images are
detected and separated into individual image lists (for all filters, i.e. here
on / off).

    # This is a DataSet object and performs file separation and creation of 
    # on / off, dark / offset lists for all images in the specified time window

    # the following high level method calls several funcitons in the 
    # CellCalibEngine class, most importantly the method find_cells for on and
    # off band image time series, which detects sub time windows for each cell
    # and background images. After the individual time windows are detected for
    # each cell and filter, the method _assign_calib_specs is called, which
    # assigns the SO2 CD amount (specified above in dictionary calib_cells) 
    # to the detected sub time windows (both for on and off) based on the depth 
    # of the intensity dip (in the onband) for each sub time window (should 
    # become clear from the plot produced in this script). Then it creates 
    # CellImgList objects for each of the cells and for the detected background
    # images (i.e. resulting in (M + 1) x 2 lists, with M being the number of 
    # detected intensity dips, the + 1 is the corresponding background list and
    # times 2 for on / off)

"""Pyplis example script no. 6 - DOAS calibration and FOV search.

Script showing how to work with DOAS calibration data

In this script, a stack of plume AA images from the Etna test data is imported
as well as a time series of DOAS SO2-CDs in the plume retrieved using the
software DOASIS (see directory "spectra" in test data folder for corresponding
analysis details, the folder also contains the RAW data and the jscript code
for analysing the spectra). The DOAS result import is performed using the
Python package ``pydoas``.

Based on these data, position and shape of the DOAS FOV within the camera
uimages is identified using both FOV search methods (IFR and Pearson). The
results of the FOV search are plotted as well as the corresponding calibration
curves retrieved for both FOV parametrisations.

Note
------

In caae a MemoryError occurs while determining the AA image stack, then the
stack (3D numpy array) is too large for the RAM. In this case, try
increasing script option PYRLEVEL_ROUGH_SEARCH.

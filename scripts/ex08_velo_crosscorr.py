# the time series of PCS profiles for both lines are stored as
# ProfileTimeSeriesImg objects using the following names. The images
# contain the PCS profiles (y-axis) for each image in the list (y-axis)
# and have thus dimension MXN where M denotes the pixel number of the lines
# and N denotes the total number of images from which the profiles are
# extracted. The images will be stored in SAVE_DIR after this script is run
# once. After that, re-running the script and applying the cross-correlation
# analysis will be much faster, since the profiles are imported from the
# two precomupted images and do not need to be extracted by looping over
# the image list.

"""Pyplis introduction script 4 - Automatic creation of image lists.

The previous script gave an introduction into the manual creation of
``ImgList`` objects and some basic image preparation features.
In this script, a number of ImgList objects (on, off, dark low gain,
dark high gain, offset low gain, offset high gain) is created automatically
using the Camera class created in example script ex0_2_camera_setup.py (ECII
camera)

Based on the information stored in the Camera class, a MeasSetup class is
created. The latter class collects all meta information relevant for an
emission rate analysis. Apart from the camera specs, this may include source
definitions  contains information about the camera specs a the
image base directory (note that in this example, start / stop acq. time stamps
are ignored, i.e. all images available in the specified directory are imported)

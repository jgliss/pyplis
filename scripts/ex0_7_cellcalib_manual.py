"""Pyplis introduction script no. 5: manual cell calibration.

Perform manual cell calibration based on 3 cell images and one background
image. The calibration data consists of 3 cells which were put in front of the
lense successively and a background images both before and after the
cell images.

This script creates an empty CellCalibEngine object in which 6 cell images
are assigned (3 on and 3 off band) with their corresponding SO2 column
densities. Further, 2 background images are assigned for each filter, one
before and one after the cells were put in front of the camera. These are used
to determine tau images from the cell images. Variations in the background
intensities are corrected for (for details see manuscript).

Note, that this calibration does not include a dark correction of the images
before the calibration, therefore, the results are slightly different compared
to the results from ex05_cell_calib_auto.py.

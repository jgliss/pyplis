"""Pyplis example script no. 1 - Analysis setup for example data set.

In this script an example data set, recorded on the 16/9/15 7:06-7:22 at
Mt. Etna is setup. Most of the following example scripts will use the
information specified here.

A typical analysis setup for plume image data contains information about the
camera (e.g. optics, file naming convention, see also ex0_2_camera_setup.py),
gas source, the measurement geometry and the wind conditions. These information
generally needs to be specified by the user before the analysis. The
information is stored within a MeasSetup object which can be used as a basis
for further analysis.
If not all neccessary information is provided, a MeasSetup object will be
created nonetheless but analysis options might be limited.

Such a MeasSetup object can be used as input for Dataset objects which
creates the analysis environment. The main purpose of Dataset classes
is to automatically separate images by their type (e.g. on / off-band
images, dark, offset) and create ImgList classes from that. ImgList
classes typically contain images of one type. The Dataset also links
relevant ImgList to each other, e.g. if the camera has an off-band
filter, and off-band images can be found in the specified directory,
then it is linked to the list containing on-band images. This means,
that the current image index in the off-band list is automatically
updated whenever the index is changed in the on-band list. If
acquisition time is available in the images, then the index is updated
based on the closest acq. time of the off-band images, based on the
current on-band acq. time. If not, it is updated by index (e.g. on-band
contains 100 images and off-band list 50. The current image number in
the on-band list is 50, then the off-band index is set to 25). Also,
dark and offset images lists are linked both to on and off-band image
lists, such that the image can be correccted for dark and offset
automatically on image load (the latter needs to be activated in the
lists using ``darkcorr_mode=True``).

This script shows how to setup a MeasSetup object and create a Dataset object
from it. As example, the first image of the on-band image time series is
displayed.

The Dataset object created here is used in script  ex04_prep_aa_imglist.py
which shows how to create an image list displaying AA images.

"""Pyplis example script no. 2 - Features of the MeasGeometry class.

In this script, some important features of the MeasGeometry class are
introduced. The class itself is automatically created in the MeasSetup
object which was created in example script ex01_analysis_setup.py and was
passed as input for a Dataset object. The relevant MeasGeometry class is stored
within the Dataset object and can be accessed via the ``meas_geometry``
attribute.

As a first feature, the viewing direction of the camera is retrieved from the
image using the position of the south east (SE) crater of Mt.Etna. The result
is then visualized in a 2D map to give an overview of the geometry. The map
further includes the initial viewing direction (see example script
ex01_analysis_setup.py) which was logged in the field using a compass and a
mechanical inclinometer.

Further, the distance to the plume is retrieved on a pixel basis (represented
as image).
